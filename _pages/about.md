<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a 3nd-year PhD student of [AIM Lab](http://aim-nercms.whu.edu.cn/) at [National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software (国家多媒体软件工程技术研究中心)](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (武汉大学)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), extremely fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/). I was also a visiting student (2023.10---2024.10) supervised by Prof. [Shin'ichi Satoh](https://researchmap.jp/satoh/) at [NII](https://www.nii.ac.jp/). Throughout my studies, I have been fortunate to collaborate closely with [Zhixiang Wang](https://lightchaserx.github.io/). I obtained my master's degree from [Wuhan University of Science and Technology](https://en.wust.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Xin Xu](http://www.vai-lab.com/member/XuXin.html).

My research interests lie in data-centric AI, such as subset selection for computer vision (for robust AI and green AI).
